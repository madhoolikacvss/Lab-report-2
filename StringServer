TASK 1 

When I created StringServer.java, I borrowed the ideas from NumberServer.java and modified the methods used there to suit String data type.


My main method from the class StringServer takes in an argument (the server number) given by a user from VSCode's terminal and uses Server.java to create a local server.
My code uses the method `handleRequest(URI url)` from the class Handler to read the path in the url and detect the query (the word being added).
For example, I used the command `java StringServer 55100` where 55100 is the server number. 
What are the relevant arguments to those methods, and the values of any relevant fields of the class?
How do the values of any relevant fields of the class change from this specific request? If no values got changed, explain why.
